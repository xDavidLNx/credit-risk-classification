## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Generate a model that accurately classifies the risk of a loan.
* In the analyzed dataset, the features compile the profile of the loans.
* The classification classifies the risk of the loan based on the characteristics of the loan.
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Balanced accuracy: 99%
  * Healthy loan precison: 100%
  * High-risk loan precision: 84%
  * Healthy loan recall: 99%
  * High-risk loan recall: 98%



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Balanced accuracy: 99%
  * Healthy loan precison: 99%
  * High-risk loan precision: 99%
  * Healthy loan recall: 100%
  * High-risk loan recall: 84%


## Summary

Both models result in good accuracy and precision however the first one overall provides the best precision results.
